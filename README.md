# RiverTwin River temperature
This is the chapter of my PhD (chapter 5) titled: 
It is also being written up for publication
## River temperature from space: A constellation of constellations. 
Valman, S., Boyd, D., Rincon, E., and Dugdale, S. 

## Content:

* Analysis
    - contains all the code. Wrapper functions in interfaceFunctions
      * interface now runs the download and watermask to check it works. The closest points can be seperated and run seperately. 
    - management functions for main processing function (in interfaceFunctions)
    - temperature functions for WSTprocessing function (in interfaceFunctions)
    - interface will contain scripts to create outputs for the paper
    - figures will contain scripts and stats for figures/tables in paper

* Data
    - should contain all raw imagery and altered data - contents only on harddrive version

The project will present this framework of using planetscope create watermasks for TIR imagery
