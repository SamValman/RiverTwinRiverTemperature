figures are split into Methods (M), Results (R), and potential (P)
R1.	Temp changed by anthropogenic causes 
-	Nuclear
R2.	Automating would not work well with alternative CLs
R3.	Satellite overpass time – more sats == more images 
R4.	Number of satellites per site
R5.	Scatter plots of points – we can see many variations and measures downstream
R6.	Line graph – select few – important points highlighted. E.g., nuclear
R7.	Days over 30 or whatever for each site.

M1. 	Method diagram
M2. 	basemap of sites
M3. 	table of sites
 

P1. 	contourPlot
P2. 	Satellite coverage years (table)
